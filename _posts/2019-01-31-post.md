We’re proud to announce the fourth <a href="https://residency.chaincode.com/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chaincode residency</a>, to be hosted in our new
office in Midtown Manhattan this summer.

Supporting the developer community and helping new contributors get their start
in Bitcoin protocol development is a key part of our mission. Over the past
three years, our residency programs have helped many developers start
contributing to Bitcoin projects. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbosworth"

This summer’s edition is our most ambitious yet, building on the experience
we’ve gained from our previous residencies. Our new office has allowed us to
radically expand the scope and duration:

- The first three weeks will consist of a seminar and discussion series, giving
  all residents a thorough grounding in Bitcoin and Lightning protocol
  development. Seminars will be led by Chaincode employees and guest speakers,
  including some of the most prolific contributors in Bitcoin and Lightning
  protocol development. Previous guest speakers include <a
  href="https://github.com/sipa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pieter
  Wuille</a>, Peter Todd, <a href="https://twitter.com/tdryja" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Tadge Dryja</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/alexbosworth"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Bosworth</a>, <a
  href="https://twitter.com/snyke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian
  Decker</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/theuni" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Cory Fields</a>.

- Armed with this knowledge, the residents will spend the next two months
  writing code and making impactful contributions to open source Bitcoin and
  Lightning projects. Each resident will be paired with a mentor to help guide
  them through the process and will have access to the Chaincode team and their
  peers for day-to-day help. We’ve recruited some exceptional protocol engineers
  to act as mentors, including <a href="https://twitter.com/snyke"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian Decker</a>, <a
  href="https://github.com/instagibbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory
  Sanders</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thebluematt" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Matt Corallo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sstone"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrice Drouin</a>, and many more.

Bitcoin is blessed with an extraordinarily generous developer community. Our
volunteer mentors are some of the leading contributors to the Bitcoin and
Lightning protocols, and they’re devoting their time to help train and educate
the next generation of protocol developers.

We’re looking for developers from all backgrounds to apply. The only
requirements are that you want to learn about Bitcoin and Lightning and that
you’re excited about the prospect of spending summer writing code and
contributing to open source Bitcoin projects. We’ll set each resident up with
accommodation and a stipend to support living expenses in New York for the
summer. International applicants are welcome.

If you want to experience a life-changing educational experience in one of the
most vibrant cities in the world, we invite you to apply. Come join us and make
this your summer of Bitcoin!
