Following last fall’s successful program, Chaincode Labs is hosting another
residency program in January/February 2018. This year we’re holding two
sessions, each lasting two weeks.

<u>Session A</u> (January 29th — February 9th) is appropriate for developers
who already work on Bitcoin or Bitcoin applications and who want an opportunity
to dive deep into protocol design, adversarial thinking, threat models and
security considerations with long-standing Bitcoin Core developers. We will
also discuss Bitcoin’s most pressing challenges: scaling, fungibility and
privacy.

### Topics covered:

- Categorization of threat models: centralization pressures, consensus issues,
  user protection, privacy and fungibility
- Mining: history, pools, mining centralization pressures, mining games
- Soft forks: approaches and history, Flag day upgrades, IsSuperMajority
  signaling, BIP9 signaling, BIP148 UASF, BIP91, etc
- Hard forks: history, current research, consensus and network considerations
- Consensus approaches: proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, other models
- Fungibility and scalability: trade-offs for different approaches, chain
  analysis, fungibility technologies, signature aggregation, key aggregation
- Smart contracts and trustless systems: lightning, tumblebit, sidechains,
  discreet log contracts and scriptless scripts

<u>Session B</u> (February 12th — February 23rd 2018) is appropriate for
software developers with an interest in Bitcoin technologies and who want to
contribute to Bitcoin Core or other open source Bitcoin projects, but who have
not yet done so. 
  
### We will cover aspects such as:

- History and philosophy of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Core project, the BIP
  process, important 
- Contributing to Bitcoin Core: examples of PRs and code rev
- The architecture of Bitcoin 
- Bitcoin consensus and transact
- The P2P net
- A history of chain forks and fail
- SegWit: rationale, history, design, activa
- Payment channels and light

Candidates who are able to dedicate four weeks to working on Bitcoin may apply
to both sessions. Expect both sessions to be very hands-on. We’ll spend about
half the time on talks covering the topics above, not to mention great
conversation over lunch. Primarily, though, you’ll learn by doing — either by
carrying out independent research and investigating systems you find
interesting in the space, or by contributing to Bitcoin Core or related
projects while collaborating with established Bitcoin Core developers. Talks
will primarily be led by Matt and John, with input from Alex, Suhas and Russ.
There may also be guest speakers over the four weeks.

### Wednesday Night Meetups

To extend participation to those who live in the New York area but are not able
to dedicate two or four weeks to attending the Residency program, we are also
opening our doors to a small number of participants on Wednesday evenings in
the weeks leading up to the Residency. We’ll go over some of the material from
the Residency program and be on hand to help with your Bitcoin Core PR or
related project.

If you’ve wanted to contribute to Bitcoin Core or are working on an open-source
Bitcoin project and want some guidance from established Bitcoin Core
contributors in an informal setting, this is a great opportunity.
