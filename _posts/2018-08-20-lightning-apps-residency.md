Chaincode is proud to announce a <a
href="https://http://lightningresidency.com/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Lightning applications residency program</a>, taking place in
New York, Oct 22–26 2018!  We’ve already hosted two residency programs, in <a
href="http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/08/08/chaincode/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a href="https://hackerresidency.com/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>. Those were focused on the Bitcoin
protocol and contributing to Bitcoin Core. This time we’re going to try
something a bit different.

The Lightning network is maturing every day and we’re beginning to see great
applications like <a href="https://satoshis.place/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">satoshis.place</a> and <a href="https://yalls.org/"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">yalls.org</a> being built on top of it. There’s
a huge amount of excitement growing around Lightning applications, but
knowledge of how to build those applications is currently scarce and
diffuse.

We want to help bootstrap the emerging Lightning applications developer
ecosystem, so we’re hosting a week-long residency specifically for Lightning
application developers (as opposed to Lightning protocol developers), organised
by us, with mentoring and speaking by experts in the Lightning applications
space.

### We’ve got a stellar line-up of guest speakers:

- <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Stewart_5" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Chris Stewart</a> is the founder of <a
  href="https://suredbits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuredBits</a>, a
  real-time micropayment-powered data service, built on top of the Lightning
  network. He is also the maintainer of <a href="https://yalls.org/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin-s</a> and a former Chaincode
  resident.

- <a href="https://twitter.com/snyke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian
  Decker</a> is an engineer at Blockstream and is a maintainer of the <a
  href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">c-lightning</a> Lightning implementation. He is also co-author
  of the 2015 <a
  href="https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/716b955c130e6c703fac336ea17b1670/duplex-micropayment-channels.pdf"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duplex Micropayment Channels</a> paper and the
  2018 <a href="https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">eltoo paper</a>.
 
- <a href="https://twitter.com/eiaine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elaine
  Ou</a> is an engineer at <a href="http://globalfinancialaccess.com/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Financial Access</a>. She has implemented
  the <a href="https://github.com/elaineo/LightningBuddy" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">LightningBuddy</a> and <a
  href="https://github.com/elaineo/Jellybean" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Jellybean</a> applications on top of Lightning.
 
- <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMallers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack
  Mallers</a> is the lead developer of <a href="http://zap.jackmallers.com/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">zap</a>, a desktop and iOS wallet for Lightning
  payments
  
- <a href="https://twitter.com/juscamarena" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">Justin Camarena</a> is an engineer at <a
  href="https://www.bitrefill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitrefill</a>,
  the first payment processor to accept mainnet Lightning payments. He was the
  lead engineer for integrating Lightning into bitrefill’s payment system.
 
- <a href="https://twitter.com/lightningk0ala" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">lightningk0ala</a> is the creator of the wildly popular <a
  href="https://satoshis.place/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">satoshis.place</a> Lightning app. He’s an expert on
  Lightning-powered games.

We’re looking for experienced applications developers, perhaps with a
background in web apps or Ethereum apps, who want to learn about integrating
Lightning payments into applications. No experience of the Bitcoin or Lightning
protocols are required.

The residency will be project-based, and applicants will build a prototype
application over the course of the week. Residents will have a chance to
present their work on Friday afternoon.

All guest speaker talks and presentations will be video recorded and made
freely available. We want to scale the benefits of this residency to engineers
who aren’t able to join us in person.
  
We’re really excited about this new residency and are looking forward to some
excellent talks and amazing new Lightning applications
