This summer, we hosted our first internship program at Chaincode Labs.  After
an extensive interview and technical code challenge process, we selected [Troy
Giorshev](https://twitter.com/troygiorshev), studying at [Queens
University](https://www.queensu.ca/), and [Hope
Yen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hope-yen-hk/), studying at [Carnegie
Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/), to work alongside Chaincode mentors while
becoming immersed in the Bitcoin Core and Lightning communities. Their time
with us came to an end in August, and we're excited to see what they do next.

Before he left us for his final year at university, we spoke to Troy about his
experience at Chaincode, and what future interns and Bitcoin open source
contributors can expect.

#### Q: What were your overall impressions of working at Chaincode on open source software?

The summer was rewarding beyond my wildest dreams. I was embraced by
a worldwide community, whose skilled members advised me as I proposed projects
and supported me as I built them, I dove deep into a storied codebase,
learning and pushing my limits every step of the way, and despite having only
worked for a few months, I was able to review the work of others and influence
the future of Bitcoin.

#### Q: What software project were you contributing to?

I worked on Bitcoin Core, which is the predominant software Bitcoin users run
to interact with the blockchain, wallet, and network. It's an open source
project, and the process for contributing is a little different from working on
a proprietary project.

#### Q: What was your summer project? How did you propose that to the community?

In my previous experiences as a developer, I was assigned tasks and had very
little say over the direction of development efforts. So proposing a project in
this capacity is not something I’d ever done before. Even the few times I
had proposed projects, the stakeholders were clear. When working on Bitcoin
Core, I had to propose my project to other developers with far more knowledge
of the codebase! Consistently, though, the community was willing to give me a
shot and motivated me to see the project through.

One thing that's obviously different is that there are no Project Managers
here! The maintainers (people who have the ability to merge changes into the
repository) do not give direction. The best contributors to Bitcoin are
self-driven and flexible.

After some guidance from my mentor, I had a project picked out. I'd add message
dumping and usage statistics to our P2P connections, allowing developers and users
to debug P2P issues and gain visibility into what's happening on those connections.

I started by writing up and posting a [design
document](https://gist.github.com/troygiorshev/f2fedca9b2ab8a2c6449c92d92e17678),
outlining the goals of the project and its capabilities, which gave everyone in
the community a chance to review my proposal. It showed I was open to critique
and willing to work towards a solution with others. After getting feedback, the
next step was to make a proof of concept so that other developers could try the
functionality for themselves. I built my proof of concept, wrote a clear
description, and opened [the
Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509).

#### Q: And what happens after you've opened a PR?

With my PR open, contributors started leaving review comments. Oh so many
review comments! I grew tremendously as a developer by defending my design
decisions. When I was [asked](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19509#l-54) why I
was focused on a minimal file descriptor usage, I was able to point at both the
history of the project and to a [currently open
issue](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19509#l-81) to justify my choice. With
Bitcoin Core being a security-critical application, I was given the chance to
[critically
examine](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19509#issuecomment-661838550)
whether my work could open up a DoS vector, and I had to justify why what I had
written was safe. The questions were tough but fair. Consistently reviewers
were respectful, and it was clear they had the best interests of Bitcoin in
mind. As long as I was clear and responded with the same amount of respect,
the conversations came to something useful.

At the time of writing, my PR is still open. I am still making changes, and
others are still reviewing it. Bitcoin is a long-running project, and the cost
of a bug is immense, so it does not move quickly. Only when a PR has an
abundance of review and when maintainers are confident that all aspects of the
addition have been explored will a PR be merged.

#### Q: What was your day-to-day work like?

Bitcoin Core is a security-critical and highly performant application. Because
of this, the opportunity repeatedly arose to have technical discussions and
make considerations that, in other projects, may be passed over. One example of
this was a small change in one of my PRs, changing the return value of a
function to be an Optional. An Optional type allows you to return either a
value or a null, and is an alternative to, say, returning a Boolean and passing
out a value by reference.  When implementing this change, I had to verify it
was being done in a sufficiently performant way (i.e. that the method was not
needlessly making copies of the object it was returning). I verified this not
by simply trusting documentation but by digging [deep into the implementation
of the Optional
type](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html).
As someone who had not worked significantly in C++ before, this gave me lots to
explore. In the end, I was able to justify to others that my code was the best
it could be.

#### Q: How else did you contribute to the Bitcoin Core project this summer?

The best way to participate in the community and to help out Bitcoin is to
review PRs. Bitcoin’s community is filled with world-class developers and
applied cryptographers. They come from a variety of backgrounds, but all come
together under the common purpose of pushing Bitcoin forward. The success of
open source development projects like Bitcoin rests on good review, and there
is no shortage of interesting PRs waiting to be explored.

When reviewing a PR, it's not enough just to review the changes themselves.
The changes need to be understood in context with the rest of the project, and
the changes need to be approved both in concept and in implementation. As a
reviewer, this gave me a great opportunity to explore new parts of the
codebase. It was occasionally necessary to perform “code archaeology” by
[digging
through](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19107#issuecomment-674243013)
the git history of the project, exploring when a feature was introduced and how
it evolved. I was consistently surprised by what I learned! Overall, it has
taken many years for this process to become what it is today. Bitcoin has had
an [eventful
past](https://b10c.me/blog/004-the-incomplete-history-of-bitcoin-development/)
and given the hard work of contributors, I know it will continue to have an
exciting future! 

#### Q: What are some concrete steps aspiring contributors can take to get more involved in the Bitcoin development process?

First, get yourself set up with an IRC client. A good command line option is
[irssi](https://irssi.org/), but if you are someone who would rather use a
mouse, there are various GUI options available. Join us on
[Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/) over at `#bitcoin-core-dev`. Another great
place to get started is the [Bitcoin Core PR Review
Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/), which is an open meeting that happens every
Wednesday at 1700 UTC on `#bitcoin-core-pr-reviews`. Each week the host will go
over an interesting or unique PR, accompanied by notes and questions, with the
goal of helping you get used to Bitcoin’s PR review process. The review club is
designed for newcomers and everyone is welcome to come and ask questions. Check
out [the intro guide](https://bitcoincore.reviews/your-first-meeting) for more
on how to get started.

Eventually, you will want to join other communication channels. The best
option is the [Bitcoin Optech
Newsletter](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/). It posts every week,
giving a curated summary of everything going on in the Bitcoin space including
discussions occurring on the [bitcoin-core-dev mailing
list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-core-dev).  On
the mailing list itself, you can find the unfiltered technical discussions on
the cutting-edge of Bitcoin development.

Once you have a node set up, a great resource is [Learning Bitcoin from the
Command
Line](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).
If you are ever confused, check out Jameson Lopp’s [Bitcoin Information and
Resources page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information.html), which is a gold
mine of Bitcoin knowledge. And when you're ready to start working on the code,
go read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
It will be your best friend going forward.

There are mentors out there, but sometimes they are hard to find. I can not
stress the value of mentorship enough, especially for someone new to
development. I had the privilege of working under [John
Newbery](https://twitter.com/@jfnewbery), who guided me through navigating both
the codebase and the unique world of open source development. 

If you need a hand, reach out to me. You can find me on twitter at
[@troygiorshev](https://twitter.com/troygiorshev) and on IRC at `troygiorshev`.

And last but certainly not least:

Go review a PR!
