# Chaincode website

The Chaincode website is built using Jeykll.

## Development

You'll need [Ruby & Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to run the site locally. Once they're setup:

* Clone the repository and go into the directory
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `make preview`
* Go to http://localhost:4000
